Implementation Profile: **Contains**.

> Implementation Profile of the operation Contains, whose meaning is its activity type (activityType): the signature of the Generic Profile Binary spatial predicate, bound to data exchange formats.

## Activity type

The meaning of the operation -- its definition, the standards that define it and its illustration -- is the activity type [`generic-profiles.activity-type.contains`](../../activity-type/contains/) (`activityType`), not this profile.

## Source

Two standards define this operation at different levels -- the abstract semantics, and the
concrete SQL binding an Implementation Profile is specifically meant to add (OGC 14-065 WPS 2.0.2
§7.5.3, "down to the supported data exchange formats"):

- [OGC 06-103r4 Simple Feature Access - Part 1: Common Architecture](https://www.ogc.org/standards/sfa/), §6.1.19 -- the
  operation's abstract definition (this is what [its Concept](../../concept/vector-geometry-processing/)
  and [Generic Profile](../../generic-profile/binary-spatial-predicate/) are grounded in too).
- ISO/IEC 13249-3:2016 *SQL multimedia and application packages -- Part 3: Spatial*, §5.1.11 ST_Contains
  -- the same operation bound to SQL: the `ST_Geometry` type and the `ST_Contains` function name,
  of which this Implementation Profile's `prefLabel` (`Contains`) is the SFA name without the `ST_`
  prefix SQL/MM adds. SQL/MM is why this tier exists at all: it is, precisely, an implementation
  profile of Simple Feature Access for SQL -- the same abstract operation, bound to one concrete
  language and type system, still not any one vendor's specific deployment of it.

## Data formats

`geometry1`, `geometry2`: GML -- the register's minimal default (Table 21, D: Declare), grounded in the real ZOO-Project Geonovum testbed, whose SQL/MM processes expose geometries as `text/xml` (GML) only, never WKT or GeoJSON (checked across `Intersects`, `Buffer`, `Intersection`). `result` (Boolean) carries no data format.

Per [OGC 14-065 WPS 2.0.2 §7.5.4 Table 21](https://docs.ogc.org/is/14-065/14-065.html#32), a specific deployment may *Extend* (E, footnote d) this minimal default with additional formats it happens to support -- this tier intentionally does not pre-empt that.

## Register position

Third tier of the four-tier model (OGC 14-065 WPS 2.0.2 §7.5): Concept -> Generic Profile ->
**Implementation Profile** -> Implementation (instance level). The fourth tier is not part of
this register: see [`ospd.process-profiles.sqlmm.contains`](https://github.com/GeoLabs/bblocks-process-profiles/tree/master/_sources/sqlmm/contains)
in `bblocks-process-profiles` -- a real process of the ZOO-Project Geonovum testbed
(<https://host1.tb.geonovum.geolabs.fr/ogc-api/processes/Contains>), which matches this tier's own minimal default (GML), specialised to one concrete version and root element, GML 3.1.0 Polygon.
